Optionally, the processing of multi-step watchers can be cancelled by other events.<br>However, it is not possible to use EventWatcher to act upon generic device level change events Use the ConditionSwitch, IfThen, LogicalRules, ... modules to process these events.<br>Check <a href=https://github.com/maros/Zway-EventWatcher/blob/master/README.md>github.com/maros/Zway-EventWatcher</a> for detailed documentation.",
